    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy applies to the FPV Mate - Viewer mobile application
      (hereinafter referred to as the "Application"), developed by TEKFORK LLC -
      FPV Mate - Series 1 (hereinafter referred to as the "Service Provider").
      The Application is provided as a commercial service and is delivered "AS
      IS."
    </p>

    <br /><strong
      >What Information Does the Application Obtain and How Is It Used?</strong
    ><br />
    <strong>User Provided Information</strong>
    <p>
      The Application may request information you provide when you download and
      register the Application. Registration with the Service Provider is not
      mandatory, but certain features of the Application may require you to
      register.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Service Provider does not collect cookies or use any user data for
      direct marketing purposes. The Application may securely store network
      information (such as SSID and password) in Apple's Keychain to facilitate
      seamless reconnection to your FPV device.
    </p>

    <br /><strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong>
    <p>
      The Application may collect certain information automatically, including
      but not limited to: the type of mobile device you use, your device's
      unique ID, the IP address of your device, your mobile operating system,
      the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information about how
      you use the Application.
    </p>

    <br /><strong>Location Information and Geofencing</strong>
    <p>
      The Application may request access to your device’s location solely for
      the purpose of verifying that its use is not occurring in restricted
      geographic areas (e.g., warzones or other prohibited regions). The
      Application uses this geolocation check to determine compliance with
      applicable laws and usage restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>Important details regarding location data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Local Processing Only:</strong> Your location data is processed
        entirely on your device. The Application checks your device’s location
        against a list of restricted geographies stored within the Application
        itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Storage or Transfer:</strong> The Application does not store
        your location coordinates, nor does it transmit location data off your
        device.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Permission-Based:</strong> You may choose not to grant the
        Application access to your device’s location. However, if you do not
        grant permission, you may be unable to use certain features that require
        verification of your location.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br /><strong
      >Do Third Parties See and/or Have Access to Information Obtained by the
      Application?</strong
    >
    <p>
      Only aggregated, anonymized data may be periodically transmitted to
      external services to help the Service Provider improve the Application and
      related services. The Service Provider may share information with third
      parties only as described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically
      Collected Information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal
        process.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the Service Provider believes in good faith that disclosure is
        necessary to protect its rights, protect your safety or the safety of
        others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
      </li>
      <li>
        To trusted service providers who work on the Service Provider's behalf,
        who do not have an independent use of the information disclosed to them,
        and have agreed to adhere to this Privacy Policy.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br /><strong>What Are My Opt-Out Rights?</strong>
    <p>
      You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by
      uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes available as
      part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or
      network.
    </p>

    <br /><strong>Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</strong>
    <p>
      The Service Provider will retain User Provided data for as long as you use
      the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. Automatically
      Collected information may be retained for up to 24 months and may
      thereafter be stored in aggregate form. If you would like the Service
      Provider to delete User Provided Data that you have provided through the
      Application, please contact them at
      <a href="mailto:support@fpvmate.com">support@fpvmate.com</a>. The Service
      Provider will respond within a reasonable time. Please note that some or
      all User Provided Data may be required for the Application to function
      properly.
    </p>

    <br /><strong>Children</strong>
    <p>
      The Service Provider does not knowingly solicit data from or market to
      children under the age of 13. If you become aware that a child under 13
      has provided personal information, please contact the Service Provider at
      <a href="mailto:support@fpvmate.com">support@fpvmate.com</a>.
    </p>

    <br /><strong>Security</strong>
    <p>
      The Service Provider is concerned with safeguarding the confidentiality of
      your information. They provide physical, electronic, and procedural
      safeguards to protect information processed and maintained. For example,
      access to this information is limited to authorized employees and
      contractors who need to know it to operate, develop, or improve the
      Application. While efforts are made to protect your information, no
      security system can prevent all potential security breaches.
    </p>

      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The
      Service Provider will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last
      Updated" date at the bottom of this page. Continued use of the Application
      after any changes signifies your consent to the revised Privacy Policy.
